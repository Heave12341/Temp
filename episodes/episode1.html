        <h1>The Strange Dragon</h1>
        <p>In a world of magic and wonder, there once lived a boy named Albert who was a unique blend of dwarf and elf. Despite the fantastical surroundings, he was just an average boy.</p>
        <p>Despite not having the longevity of the elves, the drinking capacity of the dwarves, or the intelligence of the mages, he yearned to showcase his superiority over others.
            He decided to embark on a quest to liberate a dragon held captive by a malevolent kingdom.
            He came across a sword embedded in a rock on the day of his journey. Although he couldn't remove it, he managed to free it from the stone, enabling him to use it albeit with less efficiency due to the rock's presence. This sword was the legendary Excalibur placed in the rock by angels, to be taken out only by a pure-hearted hero who would rid the land of its evil.
            Despite facing a perilous route through the orc-infested swamp, and the Longwyrm Lake, he remained determined to embark on his risky quest to confront the dragon.
        </p>
        <p>During the initial part of his journey, he made his way through the swamp without encountering any orcs until he arrived at the central area where orcs tended to gather. As he approached, a group of hungry orcs spotted him and began to approach him to make him their next meal. In a stroke of luck, he utilised his Sword to bash them, as he discovered that the sword was much more useful as a club than a blade because the rock near the blade was nearly indestructible. Although he was able to knock out one orc, the others retaliated and captured him, taking him to their camp where they intended to cook him. However, during an argument amongst themselves over how to season him, he was able to break free from the rope that bound him thanks to its flammability, while his cloak made from fire salamander hide was impervious to the flames. He then proceeded to the lake of the Longwyrm, while fighting anything in his path.
        </p>
        <p>The Longwyrm were a formidable species, capable of toppling mountains with a simple wave of their hand, but due to their large appetite and inability to leave bodies of water, the species had dwindled to just one wyrm. This particular wyrm fiercely guarded its ancestral home and would slaughter anyone who dared to approach it. The wyrm survived by feasting on dragonroot, which it found growing near the lake. As Albert arrived at the lake, he encountered the wyrm in the middle of its meal. The wyrm attempted to swiftly end the encounter by shooting a blast of scalding hot water from its mouth at Albert. Albert used his trusty sword to block the attack and was surprised to discover that it was more effective as a shield due to its indestructibility. The wyrm was angered by this and it quickly swallowed Albert. <br> Albert, now inside the wyrm seeing only through the light from the uvula of the wyrm which appeared to be burning, saw a little hole under the tongue of the wyrm which he realised must be from where the wyrm shoots water heating it using its uvula similar to how dragons shot out oxygen from this kind of hole to breathe fire. He first irritated the wyrm then blocked the hole right as the wyrm shot water, The pressure was so strong that it blew up the wyrm's head while launching Albert upwards, he was still alive due to his sword which had somehow protected him from the blast. He realized that the sword was able to absorb mechanical shocks quite well. Using this to his advantage he used the sword as a pogo stick, and his momentum, to quickly reach his destination. When he arrived at the kingdom, he was met with a startling sight. <br> He noticed the devastating effects of what seemed like a war. As he approached the castle where the dragon was being held captive, he noticed that many buildings had been partially burnt by purple flames that seemed to burn even water. He ignored these ominous signs and pressed on. When he encountered guards blocking his path, he quickly defeated them with his sword, which he had become quite proficient with, and entered the dungeon where the dragon was being held. Upon seeing the dragon, he was shocked to find that it had no limbs or face and looked more like a worm than a lizard. Its only feature was a mouth that burned with the same purple flames he had seen earlier. Suddenly, he heard a voice in his head. It was the voice of the worm.Albert spoke with the worm who then revealed that a mage had cast a spell, binding it to the dungeon. The spell could only be undone by a pure-hearted hero chosen by angels to cleanse the world. Albert attempted to remove the spell but failed. The worm advised him to persuade the princess of the kingdom, who was rumoured to be the hero, to undo the spell. With the worm's guidance, Albert confronted the princess and engaged in a duel. He emerged victorious by breaking her sword, allowing him to free the worm. </p>
        <p>The worm proceeded to devour all the kingdom's inhabitants except for the princess, who had taken the Excalibur and fled after freeing the worm. When she had taken the sword a very peculiar event occurred, the stone attached to the sword crumbled away the moment she wielded it and a heavenly light filled the sword.  When she swung the sword a beam of light erupted from it and destroyed the tree she aimed at. With this new powerful weapon, she went back to her town, wishing to kill both Albert and the worm. Meanwhile, the worm, a member of a race of creatures from another realm, who had come into this one via an interdimensional rift, was growing in power. It was the ability of its kind, to grow in power after consuming the essence of creatures, Its scales were now filled with a ghastly glow as it filled its ceaseless hunger for power with any living creature that showed itself to it, now strong enough to open wormholes.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Albert was looking for a sword in the armoury of the kingdom as he had lost his, When he found none he decided to take a mace as it was very similar in fashion to his old weapon. While he was practising with his mace, and the worm, hunting, the princess came back to take revenge. When she found Albert she quickly killed him with her new sword which she had found out sought its target and destroyed nothing but the enemy. She then went to the balcony of the castle to ambush the worm as soon as it came, What she didn't realize was that the worm was powerful enough to sense what had transpired and had been waiting to ambush her In her ambush. He quickly tore her to pieces and consumed her essence and then went to the armoury to his friend. He resurrected him using the Excalibur which had lost its seal after the stone was broken and was now available for anyone to use. <br> The worm and Albert then went on a rampage destroying anything in their path. Their bloodlust lasted a total of 3 days and 3 nights on the final night of which Albert had to take rest due to not sleeping. Then they returned to Albertâ€™s hometown where they ruled with an iron fist. The worm told Albert stories about its realm and Albert's realm. He told him about the orcs who kept intruders out from the swamps, making sure no one would exploit it. And also about the last longwyrm protecting a cursed blade sealed away in its ancestral home which drained the life of its user, while giving them powers rivalling those of the Excalibur. </p>
        <p>While they were merry-making and thinking which town to ransack next, in the dark, cold depths of space unbeknownst to our protagonists, a large rift opens releasing an ominous and gargantuan foe upon this world. </p>
